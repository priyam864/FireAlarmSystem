# FireAlarmSystem-IOT
curcuit simulation using tinkercad -https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eNQQbUSSYpU


Hardware Requirements.
1.  Arduino UNO Board.
2.  LM-35 Temperature Sensor
3.   Gas sensor
4.    Resistors
5.  Breadboard
6.   LED
7.  Piezo Buzzer
8.  Jumper Wires
   
Simulation software is generally used before the circuits and devices are built. It is not only that small devices can be designed on software, complex and large circuits/devices can be simulated. By this, damage can be avoided when all the hazards and implications can be avoided in the simulation itself.
we are going to design a Fire Alarm circuit using a few electrical components like Temperature and  Gas sensors using TinkerCad and interface it with Arduino. Let's start with the components we will require to build the circuit in the **#TinkerCad software.**
