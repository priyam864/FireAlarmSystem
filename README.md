# FireAlarmSystem-IOT
Circuit simulation using tinkercad -https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eNQQbUSSYpU

# Overview
This project aims to enhance fire safety using an Arduino-based system integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system is designed to detect changes in environmental conditions, such as increased temperature and smoke concentration, and provide timely alerts to help prevent fire-related incidents and minimize damage.

# Components
Hardware Requirements.
1.  Arduino UNO Board.
2.  LM-35 Temperature Sensor
3.   Gas sensor
4.   Resistors
5.  Breadboard
6.   LED
7.  Piezo Buzzer
8.  Jumper Wires

   
# How It Works
Sensors continuously monitor the environment for any rise in temperature or smoke concentration.
When a significant change is detected, the sensors send an analog signal to the Arduino UNO.
The Arduino UNO processes these signals and triggers the buzzer and LED.
The buzzer sounds and the LED lights up to alert residents of potential fire hazards.
This system is designed to provide an early warning, allowing occupants and authorities to respond promptly and mitigate the risk of fire.


Simulation software is generally used before the circuits and devices are built. It is not only that small devices can be designed on software, complex and large circuits/devices can be simulated. By this, damage can be avoided when all the hazards and implications can be avoided in the simulation itself.
